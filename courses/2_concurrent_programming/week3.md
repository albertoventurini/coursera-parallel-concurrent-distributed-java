# Actors

The *actor model* is a concurrency model where an application is made up of discrete entities called *Actors*.

An actor has three components:
* a mailbox
* local, private state
* a set of methods

The main benefit of actors is that the state can only be accessed by the actor owning it. This is in contrast with traditional object-oriented programming, where the state is class-private but not thread-private (meaning that multiple threads share the same state), thus access to the shared state must be protected with mechanisms such as locks and isolated sections.

The only way to modify an object in a pure actor model is to send messages to the actor that owns that object as part of its local state. Therefore, there's no need for locks and isolated sections when working with actors.

Actors interact with each other by passing messages. Upon receiving a message, an actor can:
* change its local state
* create more actors
* send messages

Messages from different actors can be arbitrarily reordered (there is no ordering guarantee). However, many implementations guarantee order for messages exchanged between the same pair of actors.
